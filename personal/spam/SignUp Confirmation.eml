They will also form part of a large group of trade scholars in Sussex which, as well as CITP, includes faculty and also Research Fellows in the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO). Collaboration and team working will be central to the work of both the CITP and the UKTPO, so being able to work closely with colleagues in a fast-moving and exciting area is important. This is an exciting time to join a dynamic and rapidly growing unit undertaking advanced research on international trade and trade policy.</p>

<p>The Post:</p>
<p>The Exeter Centre for Cytomics (EXCC) at the University of Exeter is seeking an experienced, enthusiastic, and motivated Data Scientist with expertise in the rapidly developing fields of multiplexed flow and imaging cytometry, and multi-omics (spatial proteomics and transcriptomics). This full-time position is based at the University of Exeter’s Streatham Campus and is available immediately.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate will be a passionate data science specialist eager to further their career by joining a vibrant and diverse community of researchers utilizing cutting-edge cytometry-based technologies. Responsibilities include designing and coding analysis pipelines in widely used programming languages (e.g., R/Bioconductor, Python, MATLAB) and analyzing complex datasets using both publicly available and commercial software packages (e.g. FlowJo, FCS Express, AI-cluster analysis tools, ImageJ, Cell Profiler). Additionally, the role involves developing novel tools using statistics, mathematics, and machine learning approaches for high-dimensional data analysis.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will collaborate closely with experts in mathematics, bioinformatics, and computing, as well as with research scientists at all levels.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2019, EXCC has become a centre of excellence providing cutting-edge innovative cytomics technologies including imaging flow cytometers (Imagestream, FlowCam), BSLII cell sorters (Bigfoot, FACSAria Fusion, Influx), spectral analyser (Aurora), conventional flow cytometers (Attune NxT, CytoFlex LX), advanced omics technologies (FlexMap3D, ChromiumX (10X)), and high-performance data analysis structure. This portfolio has been expanded by further state-of-the-art Tissue Cytomics technology MACSima System (spatial proteomics and transcriptomics) in the near future. The EXCC is a team of experienced cytometrists and a financial management administrator as full-time staff to support researchers with their cytometry projects.</p>
<p>You will be joining the EXCC team as an expert in data science and strengthening our team capabilities in the continuously developing field of high-dimensional and AI-based data analysis approaches. The post holder will contribute to the day-to-day management of the facility and will be expected to contribute to the increased effectiveness, efficiency and quality of the facility, its processes and procedures, and to support the growing research needs of a range of disciplines accessing the facility. These disciplines include biosciences, bioinformatics, data science, environmental, marine, microbiology, plant sciences, mycology and immunology along with a diverse community of collaborators working on exciting interdisciplinary projects in health and life sciences.</p>
<p>Why choose the University of Exeter?</p>
<p>We are a member of the prestigious Russell Group of research-intensive universities and in the top 150 universities in the world and the top 15 UK universities in global and national league tables.</p>
<p>We are one of the fastest growing research universities in the UK. For two successive years, we have increased our research awards to over £125 million. Our outstanding progress is recently recognised in the University’s results in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021, in which we increased the proportion of our research, which is world-leading by more than 60 per cent. We also increased the size of our research community by 70 per cent since the last exercise eight years ago – more than any other Russell Group university.</p>
<p>Have we sparked your interest?</p>
<p>Please contact Dr Raif Yuecel, Head of Cytometry, on 013292 727646 or r.yuecel@exeter.ac.uk for informal enquiries.</p>

<p>The role</p>
<p>We are seeking to appoint a fixed-term (12 months) Teaching Associate (Grade I) who can provide high quality, research informed and innovative teaching in the Department of Engineering Mathematics.</p>
<p>The postholders’ role will be focused on the delivery of teaching rather than research.</p>
<p>The post could be split across several applicants, on a part time job share basis, if appropriate.</p>
<p>What will you be doing?</p>
<p>The postholder(s) will carry out teaching to support one or more of our Undergraduate and MSc degree courses in Engineering Mathematics, Data Science, Fintech, Digital Health, and Robotics.</p>
<p>We are most keen to hear from those interested in teaching artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>You should apply if</p>
<p>This could be attractive to you if, for example, you are interested in an academic career and would like to grow your teaching and related admin experience. This could be a part-time secondment if you are currently a Pathway 2 member of staff on a fixed-term contract. In such an instance the time you spend on this secondment would be added onto the end of your current contract; this teaching post would need to articulate with the grant that is currently funding you and so the agreement of your line manager (principal investigator) would be required. Equally this post could be attractive to you if you are in the final stages of your PhD studies. The work could involve any of lecturing, marking, workshops, student project supervision, and we would discuss all of this should you be interested.</p>
<p>You should have experience of teaching at university level in subjects relevant to the Engineering Mathematics teaching portfolio. You should have a good honours degree and have (or expect to have soon) a PhD in Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Engineering or a closely related discipline. You should have good spoken and written English, a commitment to making Equality, Diversity and Inclusion happen, a strong ability for liaising with colleagues from other disciplines, outstanding interpersonal skills, an ability to work effectively within a team, and be enthusiastic and flexible. As a leading global institution, we are keen to attract the most highly talented individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds.</p>
<p>We welcome applications from all members of our community and are particularly encouraging those from under-represented groups to join us.</p>
<p>Additional information</p>
<p>For informal queries please contact:</p>
<p>Prof Tony Mulholland, anthony.mulholland@bristol.ac.uk.</p>
<p>To find out more about what it's like to work in the Faculty of Engineering, and how the Faculty supports people to achieve their potential, please see our staff blog: https://engineeringincludesme.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/</p>
<p>Our strategy and mission</p>
<p>We recently launched our strategy to 2030 tying together our mission, vision and values.</p>
<p>The University of Bristol aims to be a place where everyone feels able to be themselves and do their best in an inclusive working environment where all colleagues can thrive and reach their full potential. We want to attract, develop, and retain individuals with different experiences, backgrounds and perspectives – particularly people of colour, LGBT+ and disabled people - because diversity of people and ideas remains integral to our excellence as a global civic institution.</p>

Hi {!first_name},

How do you manage your M&A pipeline? If your process is anything like most M&A leaders I speak with, I’d guess you’re using tools like Excel, email, and Powerpoint.
Here’s how Midaxo’s customers do it.

Worth a conversation, or no?

Thanks,
Account Executive | Midaxo, Inc.
