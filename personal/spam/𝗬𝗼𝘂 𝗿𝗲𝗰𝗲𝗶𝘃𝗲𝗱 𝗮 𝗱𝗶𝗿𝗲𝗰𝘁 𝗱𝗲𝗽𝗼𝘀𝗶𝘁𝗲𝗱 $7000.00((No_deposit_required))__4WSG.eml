 Hi qnvpjrcanxlqw,

My name's Dylan Basile and I work at Event Temple. Nice to meet you and
thanks for requesting a demo.

Joining me for a quick demo will be the fastest and most efficient way for
you to see what the software is capable of.

Did any of the times on our website work for you and if so, were you able
to schedule a demo okay?
Here they are again: https://calendly.com/dylan-eventtemple/30min

If not, just let me know and we'll find something else.

It's a 17-year-old boy, too frightened to wear a kippa (a religious skullcap) on the streets of Paris. It's an Israeli restaurant owner in Berlin who is told that he will end up in the gas chambers. It's a 24-year-old Austrian who knows nothing about the Holocaust. It's the armed guards outside synagogues and Jewish schools across much of Europe. It's the online chat rooms where people peddle conspiracy theories that Jewish "globalists" run the world.
It can be violent or subtle. Overt or insidious. Political or personal. It can come from the right or the left. It exists in countries that have large Jewish populations, like France, and it also flourishes in places with smaller Jewish communities, like Poland
