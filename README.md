SpamSpotter is an email Threat-Hunting Tool. Given a list of emails, it will parse each one and give it a potential-risk score and a human-readable risk-breakdown based on the findings of its individual risk-modules.

options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -f Filename         Choose a single file to examine.
  -d DirectoryToScan  Scan all email files in the provided directory (supports .eml and .msg files)
  -V                  Use VirusTotal for analysis (Requires API Key) ((I've included one of my own for the projects sake))
  -vv                 set verbose mode (extra debugging text)
  -ai                 Several AI will parse the email-body's content, and vote on wether each consider the message to be spam or not
